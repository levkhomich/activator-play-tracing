    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        This tutorial will show you how to trace messages inside Play applications.
        You will be guided through the tracing basics, sampling, trace logging and hierarchical calls.
        To see actual results you will need to have Zipkin installed. Don't worry,
        template contains script that will install and run it.

    <h3>Akka Tracing</h3>

    <p>
        It is an <a href="https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing">Akka distributed tracing extension</a>
        which can be used as performance diagnostics and debugging tool. Distributed tracing approach of Zipkin
        (which it is based on) provides synergy with akka-remote and akka-cluster. Extension integrates with
        Play framework (covered in this template), Spray toolkit (see
        <a href="http://typesafe.com/activator/template/activator-akka-tracing" target="_blank">activator-akka-tracing</a>)
        and Finagle services.
    </p>

    <h3>Zipkin</h3>

    <p>
        <a href="https://twitter.github.io/zipkin/Architecture.html" target="_blank">Zipkin</a> is a distributed tracing
        system that helps to gather timing data for all the disparate services. It manages both collecting
        and lookup of this data through a Collector and a Query service. Zipkin was modelled after the Google Dapper paper.

        But it is better to see once:

    <h2>Template overview</h2>

    <p>
        This template shows how to enable request tracing in your Play framework applications. Application itself
        allows user to evaluate arithmetic expressions. Under the hood each submitted expression is parsed into
        AST, which, in turn, is evaluated by hierarchy of actors corresponding to tree structure. Evaluation
        requests are traced, and can be inspected using Zipkin afterwards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before running examples you will need to run Zipkin server. This can be achieved by running template's sbt tasks,
        or by running <code>"zipkin.Start"</code> main class from Activator's run menu. On the first run, Zipkin will be
        cloned from it's official repo to project's dir, then, in 5-10 minutes, it will be built and ready to go. After server
        launch, you can press <code>Stop</code> button in Activator's UI (Zipkin will continue running in background).
    </p>

    <p>
        Use <code>"zipkin.Stop"</code> or corresponding SBT task to stop tracing server.
    </p>

    <p>
        Short description of template's SBT tasks:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>sbt zipkin-start</code> launches zipkin-collector, zipkin-query and zipkin-web.
            Zipkin Web UI will be available at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>sbt zipkin-stop</code> stops all running zipkin services.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>sbt zipkin-update</code> updates installed Zipkin.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tracing overview</h2>

    <p>Every message's trace lifecycle consists of several stages:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Sampling</em>. Before actual trace is created, message needs to be successfully sampled.
            Such mechanism allows setup tracing extension to sample only some part of messages to reduce
            overhead when used in production environment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Annotating</em>. Any (created) trace can be annotated by basic and binary annotations.
            Basic annotations contain timestamp and description and can be displayed in timeline. Binary
            annotations are key-value pairs attached to trace itself.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Submitting</em>. After some message was explicitly marked as response to traced message,
            corresponding trace is sent to (external) collector service. If response remains unspecified,
            trace will be sent anyway after some timeout. Any annotations written to already submitted
            trace are ignored.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>

    <h2>Tracing API</h2>

    <h3>Scala</h3>

    <p>
        All you need is to mark all traceable messages your system uses with <code>TracingSupport</code> trait and
        mix all actors from which you want to annotate your traces with <code>PlayActorTracing</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Java</h3>

    <p>While you can access all tracing features from Java API, it can be confusing sometimes.</p>

    <p>You have two options on how to mark your traceable messages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>extend <code>japi.TracingSupport</code></li>
        <li>implement <code>BaseTracingSupport</code> and it's methods as it done in
            <a href="https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/github/levkhomich/akka/tracing/japi/TracingSupport.java"><code>japi.TracingSupport</code></a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To access extension itself, define <code>trace</code> field:</p>

<pre><code>TracingExtensionImpl trace = (TracingExtensionImpl) TracingExtension.apply(context().system());
</code></pre>

    <h3>Sampling</h3>

    <p>
        Sampling is performed automatically if you apply <code>TracingSettings</code> to your application's
        global settings (as shown in this template), or by using <code>trace.sample(msg, serviceName, rpcName)</code> method.
        It's recommended to call this method right after message was received by your actor system.
        Sampling rate can be changed using <code>akka.tracing.sample-rate</code> config parameter.
    </p>

    <h3>Trace annotations</h3>

    <p>There are several methods allowing you to annotate traces:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>trace.record(msg, annotation)</code> - attaches string annotation to message trace timeline.
            Such annotations can be used by <code>annotation</code> filter in Web UI.</li>
        <li>
            <code>trace.recordKeyValue(msg, key, value)</code> - annotates trace by key-value pair,
            where value can be represented by String, Short, Int, Long, Boolean, Double or Array[Byte].
            This kind of annotations can be used by <code>key-value</code> filter in Web UI.</li>
        <li>
            <code>trace.recordException(msg, exception)</code> - writes exception's stack trace to trace.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submitting</h2>

    <p>
        After you mark that message processing was finished by marking response with
        <code>someMessage.asResponseTo(request)</code> or, if you have no response, with
        <code>trace.finish(request)</code>. Corresponding trace will be closed and submitted
        to collector service.
    </p>

    <h2>Project setup</h2>

    <h3>SBT</h3>

    <p>Include extension to the list of your project's dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>libraryDependencies += "com.github.levkhomich" %% "akka-tracing-play" % "0.3"
</code></pre>

    <p>or, if you want to experiment with snapshot:</p>

<pre><code>resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"

libraryDependencies += "com.github.levkhomich" %% "akka-tracing-play" % "0.4-SNAPSHOT" changing()
</code></pre>

    <h3>Play config</h3>

    <p>You will need to define collector's endpoint:</p>

<pre><code>akka.tracing {
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9410 # default
}</code></pre>

    <p>Also you can setup extension to be initialized with actor system (it's not required, though):</p>

<pre><code>akka.extensions += "com.github.levkhomich.akka.tracing.TracingExtension"
</code></pre>

    <h3>Global settings</h3>

    <p>You will need mix <code>TracingSettings</code> into your application's global settings:</p>

<pre><code>object Global extends TracingSettings
</code></pre>
